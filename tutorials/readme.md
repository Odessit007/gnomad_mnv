This `tutorials` directory consists of six Jupyter notebooks:
1. `identify_mnv.ipynb` explains how to extract MNV from a vcf (or a matrix table).
2. `annotate_mnv.ipynb` explains how to annotate the functional consequences and category of MNVs
3. `functional_impact.ipynb` explains how to generate per gene (or per individual) statistics 
4. `global_mechanisms.ipynb` explains how to analyize the generation mechanisms of MNVs, genome wide (WIP)
5. `per_region_mechanisms.ipynb` explains how to partition the genome into different functional (WIP)
6. `phase_sensitivity.ipynb` explains how the phasing sensitivity analysis could be performed
category, and analyze the MNVs across categories (WIP)

Those with (WIP) are still work in progress, but will be up soon!
